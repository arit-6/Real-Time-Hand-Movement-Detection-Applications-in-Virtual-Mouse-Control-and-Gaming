## Real-Time-Hand-Movement-Detection-Applications-in-Virtual-Mouse-Control-and-Gaming

This project combines the exciting world of gaming with the innovative technology of hand gesture recognition. The game, titled "Hand Gesture Car," allows players to control a virtual car using hand gestures detected through a webcam. The project utilizes various libraries and tools including Pygame for game development, OpenCV for image processing, MediaPipe for hand gesture detection, and PyAutoGUI for controlling the mouse cursor based on hand movements.
